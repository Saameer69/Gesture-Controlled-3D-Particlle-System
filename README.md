# Gesture-Controlled-3D-Particlle-System
A high-performance, real-time interactive 3D particle system built with Three.js and MediaPipe Hands. This project showcases the fusion of computer vision and WebGL, allowing users to dynamically control complex 3D graphics using only hand gestures captured via webcam.
